=== Announcement ===
I am currently working (on my spare time) on a newer version for this series of lecture including more algorithms, better explanation, updated content and clearer notebooks.
Once the new version complete, the old version will be deleted.

!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
This is the first serie of lecture I gave on Machine Learning and it is not perfect.
Feel free to comment and criticize such that I can improve it!
Thank you!


In the present folder you can find slides, ipython notebooks and other resource materials introduced during the "Big Data II" lecture given at AIMS Senegal in January 2016.

The course is strongly inspired by the following books and websites :

- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
- http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/
- "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning" by D. Barber
- "Introduction to Machine Learning - 2nd Edition" by E. Alpaydin
- "Introduction to Machine Learning" by A. Smola and S.V.N Vishwanathan
